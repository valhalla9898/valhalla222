   - Username (required, unique)
   - Password (required, min 6 chars)
   - Full Name (required)

## Database Structure

The system uses SQLite database with the following tables:

### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,  -- SHA-256 hashed
    role TEXT DEFAULT 'user',
    full_name TEXT,
    email TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_login TIMESTAMP,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'active'
)
```

## First-Time Setup

1. **Initialize Database:**
   - The database is automatically created on first run
   - Default admin and user accounts are created automatically

2. **Change Default Passwords:**
   - Login with default credentials
   - Go to Settings → Security
   - Change your password immediately

3. **Create Additional Users (Admin):**
   - Login as admin
   - Navigate to Users
   - Create new user accounts as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Login
- Verify you're using the correct credentials
- Check that you selected the correct role (Admin vs User)
- Ensure the database file exists: `data/agentic_iam.db`

### Permission Denied
- Regular users cannot access admin features
- Login with administrator account for full access

### Password Reset
- Administrators can reset any user's password from the User Management page
- Users can change their own password from Settings → Security

## API Endpoints (Future)

The system is designed to support future API integration:
- `/api/auth/login` - User authentication
- `/api/auth/logout` - Session termination
- `/api/users` - User management (admin only)
- `/api/agents` - Agent management

## Best Practices

1. **Security:**
   - Change default passwords immediately
   - Use strong passwords (8+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
   - Regularly review user access logs
   - Disable inactive accounts

2. **User Management:**
   - Create separate accounts for each user
   - Use the principle of least privilege
   - Regularly audit user permissions
   - Remove or suspend terminated users

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Regularly check audit logs
   - Monitor failed login attempts
   - Track user activity
   - Review agent access patterns

## Development Notes

### File Structure
```
dashboard/
  components/
    login.py           # Login page and authentication
    user_management.py # User management interface (admin)
    agent_management.py # Agent management (existing)
    
database.py           # Database operations with user auth
app.py               # Main application with role-based routing
```

### Adding New Features
1. Use `is_authenticated()` to check if user is logged in
2. Use `is_admin()` to check admin privileges
3. Use `require_auth(admin_only=True)` decorator for admin-only pages
4. Use `get_current_user()` to access user information

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the audit logs for error messages
2. Verify database integrity: `data/agentic_iam.db`
3. Review application logs
4. Contact system administrator
